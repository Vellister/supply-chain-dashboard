# Supply Chain Flow Visualization with Sankey Diagram and Sales Table

This project is an exercise in data storytelling and visualization using Python. The goal was to create a realistic and visually compelling dashboard that represents the product flow in a simplified retail supply chain.

## 📊 Objective

The visual dashboard illustrates how products move from **Suppliers** to **Product Categories**, and finally to **Sales Channels** (Online and Retail Store). The project aims to simulate a business scenario using synthetic data and communicate it clearly through:

- A **Sankey diagram** showing the flow of units through the supply chain.
- A **data table** summarizing total sales by product category and sales channel.

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries

- Python 3
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Plotly (Graph Objects and Subplots)

## 📁 Project Structure

- `data_gen.py`: Generates the synthetic dataset for the supply chain flow and sales summary.
- `viz.py`: Builds the Sankey diagram and sales table, and exports the result as an interactive HTML dashboard.

## 🧠 Business Story

- **Supplier A** specializes in Electronics.
- **Supplier C** is stronger in Food distribution.
- **Online** dominates sales of Electronics.
- **Retail Stores** are the primary sales channel for Clothing.

The dashboard captures these relationships and flows in a compact, interactive format.
